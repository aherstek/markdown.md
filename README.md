**week7/8 checklist notes and timeline**
* :alarm_clock: 8am: Started my own ArcGIS Server on Google Cloud Platform. Followed Shawn's instructions (https://youtu.be/dyFeyBX9jIY) to get everything up and running. NOTE: document all passwords / IP addresses / important information Shawn addresses in the video in Notepad, as some information is only shown to you once and it is helpful to have it all safely stored.
* :alarm_clock: 9am: VM up and running. REMEMBER to turn off VM when not using! You can ensure that everything is turned off my seeing a "stop" icon on GCP and shutting down VM from start menu.
* :alarm_clock: 915am: Contiued to work through checklist steps - publishing on GCP VM into ArcGIS Server (Canada.shp used from prior weeks).
* :alarm_clock: 11am: Completed checklist. Overall it was a bit challenging - ESRI documentation and Shawn's notes/videos were helpful when stuck.
