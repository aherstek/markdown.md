_**february 29th:** setting up markdown.md doc in githubt and learning md syntax from here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax_.

**march 1:**
**week7/8 checklist notes and timeline**
* :alarm_clock: 8am: Started my own ArcGIS Server on Google Cloud Platform. Followed Shawn's instructions (https://youtu.be/dyFeyBX9jIY) to get everything up and running. NOTE: document all passwords / IP addresses / important information Shawn addresses in the video in Notepad, as some information is only shown to you once and it is helpful to have it all safely stored.
* :alarm_clock: 9am: VM up and running. REMEMBER to turn off VM when not using! You can ensure that everything is turned off my seeing a "stop" icon on GCP and shutting down VM from start menu.
* :alarm_clock: 1115am: Contiued to work through checklist steps - publishing on GCP VM into ArcGIS Server (Canada.shp used from prior weeks).
* :alarm_clock: 345pm: Completed checklist. Overall it was a bit challenging - ESRI documentation and Shawn's notes/videos were helpful when stuck.

 _**brief step by step process of set up**_

 * :thumbsup: Configuring windows account, click **Set**. Password will then be provided, write it down as it won't be easy to remember! Also, take note of internal / external IP addresses provided on the VM instance screen. They will be needed later!

 * :thumbsup: Go to your computers start menu and find Remote Desktop - log in with credentials Shawn provides (external IP needed as stated prior). A "risk" pop up will show, click **Yes**. We will then connect to the remote desktop.

 * :thumbsup: **try** input your IP used above into google - you should see image above. if you put https:// infront - you will get _"connection is not private"_ (its normal! dont worry). click advanced and proceed. now add to your url (https://IP address /arcgis/rest/services) and experiment with the manager too at arcgis/manager by logging in from Shawn's instructions.

 * :thumbsup: when shutting down server --> 3 dots, **stop** and wait until status icon is grey.

* :thumbsup: at this point I forgot to keep taking screenshots so it will be texted based from now on.
* :thumbsup: **DuckDNS (https://www.duckdns.org/) to establish new domain**
* Complete reCaptcha verification on the DuckDNS website to generate a domain. You will input the External IP from GC Console into the designated field and click to update. The resulting domain will be: your_info.duckdns.org. Following any interruptions in the Google Cloud VM, subsequent reboots will automatically regenerate the external IP. This IP, associated with the new domain, can be seamlessly updated within DuckDNS without requiring modifications in server settings or other relevant areas where VM usage is integral.
* :thumbsup: **SSL cert**
* Spark up your VM and update your IP (external) to your DuckDNS. Log into your remote desktop and open IIS Manager (it's a desktop app, search ISS). Default website is bindings. Select 443 port, edit and define domain to match your DuckDNS. Then, use https://www.win-acme.com/ and download. Run wacs.exe, click more info, run anyway. You will then set your options via code displayed on screen. Create your cert, all bindings, confirm, open T.O.S, agrree, provide your email and close window when code is done. Make sure it worked on DNS url, and you will be gvem SSL certificate viewable in your internet browser.
* :thumbsup:**publishing to AGOL**
* Sparking up your VM instance on GCP (click _Start/Resume_) and copy your external IP, go to your DuckDNS and update domain. Go to ArcGIS Rest Endpoint to check server response / it's working (log in as admin). Log into your remote desktop, and copy Canada data with the same path. In ArcGIS Pro, add new ArcGIS Server Connection. Server URL will be your DNS URL with port :6443/arcgis. Then, once logged in with siteadmin, Publish. Now check to see if it worked at the REST Directory, and you will see Canada map! You can now create a web map using this layer (via add item URL on AGOL).

**march 3:**
* :alarm_clock: 8am: clicked through optional items of week 7/8 checklist - found Shawn's demos on Geoserver interesting and followed his 5 step series on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8md6Vlz64JqOvr5P0Hua3LTVsmTpajF).
* :alarm_clock: 12pm: satified with checklist and learned a lot. An interesting thing I now know is that you can use GeoServer to your advantage and it can host your data, reducing your AGOL credits!

**march 10:**
* :alarm_clock: using chloe's and rajesh's client - city of cambridge (https://geohub.cambridge.ca/pages/operations) - dashboards to click around and play with the interface as i am not familiar. very cool interface but am concerned as to how we will show indoor floorplans / room info on this interface. leaning more towards experience builder...

**march 12:**
* :alarm_clock: found UDOT open source data on AGOL. Business building located in Utah. Group okay to use this. Uploaded into ArcGIS Pro to have a better look and play around with the layers. Plan to upload to AGOL Group once Shawn shows us how to in lecture.
* ![Screenshot 2024-03-12 094121](https://github.com/aherstek/markdown.md/assets/146446987/209adc4b-c54d-4ce9-be65-00b8d51ce3a8)

**march 13:**
* :alarm_clock: started to play with our UDOT data in ArcGIS Dashboards. Finding it difficult to easily display the multilevels. Experimented for a little bit to familiarize myself with the interface. Opened/closed settings, switched up layout.
* ![Screenshot 2024-03-13 153250](https://github.com/aherstek/markdown.md/assets/146446987/53482104-fe32-4fc8-ab04-0c9b430f4ce6)

**march 14:**
* :alarm_clock: trying to deploy floor widget in experience builder so user can view each floor independently... not working yet (view, view 2, view 3). having so many layers of a building at once is proven to be difficult to display in a easy way! also count not get the 'directions' widget to link with the UDOT data - I believe I need to select a floor but could not find where to do so. *REMEMBER* you need to unlock layout lock to access your widgets!

**march 15:**
* :alarm_clock: met with shawn with GEOM99 group 4 - he introduced us to AGOL Solutions! This is what I will begin to look into this weekend. :)
