_**february 29th:** setting up markdown.md doc in githubt and learning md syntax from here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax_.

**march 1:**
**week7/8 checklist notes and timeline**
* :alarm_clock: 8am: Started my own ArcGIS Server on Google Cloud Platform. Followed Shawn's instructions (https://youtu.be/dyFeyBX9jIY) to get everything up and running. NOTE: document all passwords / IP addresses / important information Shawn addresses in the video in Notepad, as some information is only shown to you once and it is helpful to have it all safely stored.
* :alarm_clock: 9am: VM up and running. REMEMBER to turn off VM when not using! You can ensure that everything is turned off my seeing a "stop" icon on GCP and shutting down VM from start menu.
* :alarm_clock: 1115am: Contiued to work through checklist steps - publishing on GCP VM into ArcGIS Server (Canada.shp used from prior weeks).
* :alarm_clock: 345pm: Completed checklist. Overall it was a bit challenging - ESRI documentation and Shawn's notes/videos were helpful when stuck.

 _**brief step by step process of set up**_

 * :thumbsup: when shutting down server --> 3 dots, **stop** and wait until status icon is grey.

**march 3:**
* :alarm_clock: 8am: clicked through optional items of week 7/8 checklist - found Shawn's demos on Geoserver interesting and followed his 5 step series on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8md6Vlz64JqOvr5P0Hua3LTVsmTpajF).
* :alarm_clock: 12pm: satified with checklist and learned a lot. An interesting thing I now know is that you can use GeoServer to your advantage and it can host your data, reducing your AGOL credits!

**march 10:**
* :alarm_clock: using chloe's and rajesh's client - city of cambridge (https://geohub.cambridge.ca/pages/operations) - dashboards to click around and play with the interface as i am not familiar. very cool interface but am concerned as to how we will show indoor floorplans / room info on this interface. leaning more towards experience builder...

**march 12:**
* :alarm_clock: found UDOT open source data on AGOL. Business building located in Utah. Group okay to use this. Uploaded into ArcGIS Pro to have a better look and play around with the layers. Plan to upload to AGOL Group once Shawn shows us how to in lecture.
* ![Screenshot 2024-03-12 094121](https://github.com/aherstek/markdown.md/assets/146446987/209adc4b-c54d-4ce9-be65-00b8d51ce3a8)

**march 13:**
* :alarm_clock: started to play with our UDOT data in ArcGIS Dashboards. Finding it difficult to easily display the multilevels.
* ![Screenshot 2024-03-13 153250](https://github.com/aherstek/markdown.md/assets/146446987/53482104-fe32-4fc8-ab04-0c9b430f4ce6)

**march 14:**
* :alarm_clock: trying to deploy floor widget in experience builder so user can view each floor independently... not working yet (view, view 2, view 3). having so many layers of a building at once is proven to be difficult to display in a easy way! also count not get the 'directions' widget to link with the UDOT data - I believe I need to select a floor but could not find where to do so.

**march 15:**
* :alarm_clock: met with shawn with GEOM99 group 4 - he introduced us to AGOL Solutions! This is what I will begin to look into this weekend.
